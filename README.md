Frontend Masters Javascript Hard-Parts. 

I'll be sharing my solutions for the problems in the js hard-parts courses.

Would like to take this oportunity to congratulate Will for the great teaching skills.
Thanks for the material Will!

Here's the csbin challegens you will face throughout the courses:

1. Callbacks and Higher-Order Functions http://csbin.io/callbacks
2. Closures, Scope, and ExecutionContext http://csbin.io/closures
3. Async http://csbin.io/async
4. OOP http://csbin.io/oop
5. Promises http://csbin.io/promises
6. Iterators http://csbin.io/iterators

Great courses, recommended if you are looking to take your JavaScript skills to the next level.

PS: watchout if you trying to solve the challenges on csbin.io, it's kinda buggy and it might not work with some solutions.
